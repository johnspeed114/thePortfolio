---FYI--- Look into the style and ui later, FIRST, functions and features

[x] Should have header
[x] Should have routes established through the header
[] Should sliding top photo page
[] Should graph of data top 10 or proverty line/average wealth/ api / steam games/ twitch
[] Should clean up the navbar text style and color to be like the left side
[] Should create free mason logo for the 3d object

[x]--Main priority-- use useContext and useReducer to create global state for my login
[] ==Next priority== addd registration page
[] have an user profile your account(next with usereducer)
[] add encryption for password
[] have an account setting
thoughts=> maybe no need for the useReducer for the login since it's yes or no
We will the useReducer if we pull data from the database

[] IMPORTANT create a pdf iframe added! added japanese too!

---Thoughts---
-> Three/react-three fiber has the ability to create VR/AR settings. Maybe use it later for my project?
-> Create data graphs for top 10 something? or games with top viewership on twitch and/or youtube, bilibi, facebook gaming ////or steam games(by regions)
