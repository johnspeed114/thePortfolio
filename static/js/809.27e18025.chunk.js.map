My coding\n              journey sprang from my deep-seated passion for gaming. During\n              college, I started dabbling in programming, a hobby that later\n              transformed into a full-blown career in web development.\n            </p>{\" \"}\n            <p>\n              Over the years, I've developed a strong proficiency in JavaScript,\n              HTML, CSS, TypeScript, and React, allowing me to build\n              applications that truly resonate with users' needs. The excitement\n              of solving complex challenges, coupled with my fascination for\n              technology, drives my day-to-day work.\n            </p>{\" \"}\n            <p>\n              My love for travel and cultural exploration is another dimension\n              of my life that fuels my creativity. Having lived in Japan,\n              Taiwan, China, and Israel, and traveled across Europe and East\n              Asia, I've had the privilege of experiencing a rich tapestry of\n              cultures, people, and (not to forget) cuisines! These experiences\n              have not only broadened my worldview but also enriched my\n              understanding of user perspectives from diverse backgrounds - a\n              valuable asset in my field.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Given my strong ties with the gaming world and expertise in web\n              development, I am especially intrigued by the prospect of\n              contributing to a gaming studio's web development team. This would\n              bring together my professional skills and personal passion,\n              creating a blend that I believe will lead to remarkable outcomes.\n            </p>{\" \"}\n            <p>\n              Outside the world of code and consoles, I take pride in being a\n              thorough communicator and project manager.
